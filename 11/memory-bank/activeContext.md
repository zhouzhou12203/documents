# Active Context Log for Energy Flow Diagram Creation

This file will log the detailed process of the "自动编码器" (code) mode as it creates the energy flow diagram.
*   [2025-05-29 21:30:56] - Generating Mermaid code for贵州大方电厂 energy flow diagram.
    *   **Objective**: Create a Mermaid `flowchart LR` diagram based on `memory-bank/energy_balance_table_贵州大方电厂.md` and drawing principles.
    *   **Data Source**: `memory-bank/energy_balance_table_贵州大方电厂.md`.
    *   **Drawing Principles**:
        *   Energy flow: Left to right.
        *   Inputs (购入能源): Circles (`classDef input`).
        *   Processes (转换、输送、使用): Rectangles (`classDef process`).
        *   Flows: Lines/arrows with labels.
        *   Losses: Arrows from rectangles to dedicated loss nodes (`classDef lossNodeStyle`), with values. Loss nodes display loss type and value.
        *   Balance: Ensured by using values from the balanced table.
        *   Labels: Energy values (tce) on flows and in node descriptions.

    *   **Mermaid Structure**:
        1.  **Inputs**: `CoalIn` (燃料煤), `DieselIn` (柴油).
        2.  **Core Processes**: `CoalTransport` (煤场/输送), `Boiler` (锅炉系统), `SteamPipe` (蒸汽管道), `TurbineGen` (汽机-发电机系统).
        3.  **Electricity Hub**: `TotalGeneratedElec` (总发电量) acts as a distribution point for electricity.
        4.  **Auxiliary Power**: `sgAuxPower` subgraph containing `AuxPublic` (公用系统), `AuxDesulf` (脱硫系统), `AuxOther` (其他系统). These receive power from `TotalGeneratedElec`.
        5.  **Final Output**: `NetSupply` (净外供电量).
        6.  **Losses**: Each process and auxiliary system with losses points to a styled rectangular loss node (e.g., `L_Boiler`, `L_AuxPublic`) that displays the loss details. Loss arrows are unlabelled as details are in the target loss node.

    *   **Node and Flow Mapping Details**:
        *   Input nodes like `CoalIn("燃料煤 (总购入)<br/>2,521,313 tce"):::input`.
        *   Process nodes like `Boiler["锅炉系统"]:::process`.
        *   Energy flows like `CoalTransport -- "燃料煤 (至锅炉)<br/>2,507,712" --> Boiler`.
        *   Loss flows like `Boiler -- " " --> L_Boiler["锅炉损失<br/>366,038 tce"]:::lossNodeStyle`.
        *   Electricity distribution from `TotalGeneratedElec` to consumers like `TotalGeneratedElec -- "电力 (锅炉辅机)<br/>11,937" --> Boiler`.

    *   **Generated Mermaid Code**:

*   [2025-05-29 21:41:23] - User provided feedback on the Mermaid code confirmation.
    *   **User Feedback**: "我要求生成标准的能流图，你可以直接生成，也可以使用python或者其他方式生成" (I require a standard energy flow diagram, you can generate it directly, or use python or other methods to generate it).
    *   **Interpretation**: The user is reiterating the need for a "standard" diagram. The initial request specified Mermaid as the desired output. The current Mermaid code attempts to meet this.
    *   **Action**: Will re-confirm if the provided Mermaid code is acceptable or if specific changes are needed to meet their definition of "standard" in Mermaid format, or if they now prefer a different output format despite the initial request.
*   [2025-05-29 21:44:17] - User provided an image of a standard energy flow diagram for reference.
    *   **Image Analysis**:
        *   Inputs: Simple start, no special shapes.
        *   Processes: Rectangles.
        *   Flows: Labeled arrows.
        *   Losses: Key difference - downward arrows directly from process units, labeled with loss type/value. Not separate, specially styled "loss collector" nodes.
        *   Electricity Distribution: Central generation node, distribution to rectangular auxiliary consumers, each with own downward loss arrows.
    *   **Mermaid Revision Strategy**:
        *   Input nodes: Change from `:::input` (circles) to default rectangles.
        *   Loss representation:
            *   Remove `classDef lossNodeStyle`.
            *   For each process with a loss (e.g., `Boiler`), create a standard rectangular node for the loss itself (e.g., `Boiler_Loss["锅炉损失<br/>366,038 tce"]`).
            *   Draw a directed edge from the process node (`Boiler`) to its corresponding loss node (`Boiler_Loss`).
            *   The loss node will contain the description and value of the loss.
            *   Remove empty labels (`" "`) on edges pointing to loss nodes.
        *   Other elements (processes, flows, electricity distribution logic) will remain structurally similar but adapt to the new loss representation.
    *   **Action**: Update `activeContext.md` with this analysis, then generate revised Mermaid code and ask for user confirmation.
*   [2025-05-29 21:45:06] - Generating revised Mermaid code based on user-provided image and updated strategy.
    *   **Revisions Applied**:
        *   Input nodes (燃料煤, 柴油) now use default Mermaid rectangle shapes instead of custom circles.
        *   Loss representation changed:
            *   Removed the `lossNodeStyle` class definition.
            *   Each loss is now a separate, standard rectangular node (e.g., `L_Boiler["锅炉损失&lt;br/&gt;366,038 tce"]`).
            *   The process unit (e.g., `Boiler`) directly links to its corresponding loss node (e.g., `Boiler --&gt; L_Boiler`).
            *   Labels on edges pointing to loss nodes have been removed as the loss information is now contained within the loss node itself.
    *   **Objective**: To align the Mermaid diagram more closely with the visual style of the standard energy flow diagram image provided by the user.
    *   **Next Step**: Present the revised Mermaid code to the user for confirmation.
*   [2025-05-29 21:54:53] - User provided further feedback on node shapes.
    *   **User Feedback**: "有进步，但[请在此处说明还需要调整的小地方]。燃料煤，柴油、电力用椭圆框，直接修改@/memory-bank/1.md"
    *   **Interpretation**:
        *   Nodes for "燃料煤" (CoalIn), "柴油" (DieselIn), and "电力" (TotalGeneratedElec) should be ovals.
        *   User mentioned modifying a file `memory-bank/1.md`. Will need to clarify its purpose later.
    *   **Mermaid Revision Strategy**:
        *   Change the syntax for `CoalIn`, `DieselIn`, and `TotalGeneratedElec` to use Mermaid's oval shape: `id(["text"])`.
        *   Remove any conflicting class definitions for these nodes if necessary (e.g., `:::elecNode` for `TotalGeneratedElec`).
    *   **Action**: Update `activeContext.md`, generate the revised Mermaid code with oval shapes for specified nodes, and ask for user confirmation.
*   [2025-05-29 21:55:21] - Generating revised Mermaid code with oval shapes for specified input/energy nodes.
    *   **Revisions Applied**:
        *   `CoalIn` (燃料煤), `DieselIn` (柴油), and `TotalGeneratedElec` (总发电量) nodes are now defined using Mermaid's oval shape syntax: `id(["text"])`.
        *   Removed `:::elecNode` class from `TotalGeneratedElec` as its shape is now explicitly oval.
    *   **Objective**: To meet the user's requirement for specific nodes to be oval-shaped.
    *   **Next Step**: Present the further revised Mermaid code to the user for confirmation.
*   [2025-05-29 21:58:10] - User confirmed oval shapes and requested further diagram structuring with four zones.
    *   **User Feedback**: "是的，这个Mermaid代码完美！请用它更新 memory-bank/1.md 并提交最终结果。但是要求从左往右分为四个区域：购入储存、加工转换、输送分配、最终使用，要求整体为一个矩形，从左往右三条虚线分为四个部分"
    *   **Interpretation**:
        *   The diagram needs an overall rectangular boundary.
        *   It should be divided into four vertical zones: "购入储存", "加工转换", "输送分配", "最终使用".
        *   Ideally, three dashed lines would separate these zones.
        *   The final Mermaid code should be written to `memory-bank/1.md`.
    *   **Mermaid Revision Strategy**:
        *   Use a main subgraph to represent the overall rectangle.
        *   Inside the main subgraph, create four sequential subgraphs for the zones.
        *   Place nodes into appropriate zones:
            *   **购入储存 (Zone1_PurchasingStorage)**: `CoalIn`, `DieselIn`, `CoalTransport`.
            *   **加工转换 (Zone2_ProcessingConversion)**: `Boiler`, `TurbineGen`.
            *   **输送分配 (Zone3_TransmissionDistribution)**: `SteamPipe`, `TotalGeneratedElec`, `sgAuxPower` (and its internal nodes: `AuxPublic`, `AuxDesulf`, `AuxOther`).
            *   **最终使用 (Zone4_EndUse)**: `NetSupply`.
        *   Loss nodes will remain linked to their respective processes within these zones.
        *   **Limitation**: Mermaid doesn't directly support drawing arbitrary dashed lines between subgraphs. The visual separation provided by the subgraphs themselves will serve as the zoning. This will be communicated to the user.
    *   **Action**: Update `activeContext.md`, generate the Mermaid code with zoned subgraphs, write it to `memory-bank/1.md`, and then ask for final user confirmation before `attempt_completion`.
*   [2025-05-29 21:58:46] - Generating final Mermaid code with four-zone structure.
    *   **Revisions Applied**:
        *   A main subgraph `MainDiagram` is used for the overall chart.
        *   Four nested subgraphs represent the zones: `Zone1_PurchasingStorage` (购入储存), `Zone2_ProcessingConversion` (加工转换), `Zone3_TransmissionDistribution` (输送分配), and `Zone4_EndUse` (最终使用).
        *   Nodes (including inputs, processes, and their respective loss nodes) are placed within their corresponding zone subgraphs.
        *   The `sgAuxPower` subgraph is nested within `Zone3_TransmissionDistribution`.
        *   All node shapes (ovals for inputs/electricity, rectangles for processes/losses) and connections are maintained as per previous confirmations.
    *   **Objective**: To structure the diagram into four distinct zones as requested by the user, enhancing clarity.
    *   **Next Step**: Write the generated Mermaid code to `memory-bank/1.md` and then present it to the user for final confirmation.
