# Decision Log

This log records key decisions made during the project.

## YYYY-MM-DD
- **Initial Task**: Assist user with "能源流程图 课后作业.pdf", including creating an energy balance table and an energy flow diagram.
- **Decision**: Proceed with creating foundational Memory Bank files.
- **Decision**: Delegate the creation of the energy balance table to the "规范编写器" (spec-pseudocode) mode. This subtask will analyze '00 能源流程图 课后作业.pdf' and '13 系统能量计量与统计分析.pdf' to produce the table. The subtask will be instructed to log its process in 'memory-bank/activeContext.md'.
- **Subtask Outcome (规范编写器)**: Provided pseudocode for the energy balance table and logged data analysis in `activeContext.md`. Deviated from instruction by not asking for user confirmation before its `attempt_completion`.
- **NexusCore Action**: Reviewed subtask output and `activeContext.md`. Synthesized the final energy balance table and saved it to `memory-bank/energy_balance_table_贵州大方电厂.md`, addressing data inconsistencies.
- **Decision**: Delegate the creation of the energy flow diagram to the "自动编码器" (code) mode. This subtask will use the data from `memory-bank/energy_balance_table_贵州大方电厂.md`, the diagram sketch from '00 能源流程图 课后作业.pdf', and principles from '13 系统能量计量与统计分析.pdf' to produce a textual representation of the diagram (e.g., Mermaid code). The subtask will be instructed to log its process in 'memory-bank/activeContext.md'.
- **Subtask Outcome (自动编码器)**: Successfully generated the Mermaid code for the energy flow diagram and saved it to `memory-bank/1.md`. Detailed iteration and refinement process logged in `activeContext.md`. The subtask also deviated from instructions by not asking for user confirmation before its `attempt_completion`.
- **NexusCore Action**: Reviewed subtask output and `activeContext.md`. Will now proceed to synthesize all results for the user.
